# ANOVA-12Analysis
# This repository is setted with the purpose to practive the code for the ONW-WAY ANOVA analysis for the two sets of Sample,In Order to test whether there is a significant difference in a numerical variable between three or more groups (But in this only three groups of sample as example, meanwhile there is code based on python to generate three group of data with randomly and export in the CSV.file form)

ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) is a statistical method used to detect whether there are significant differences in the means between different groups.ANOVA is particularly useful when comparing three or more groups.The basic idea is to compare within-group variation (the difference between the data points within each group and the mean of that group) with between-group variation (the difference between the means of different groups).Basic types of ANOVA include one-way ANOVA and multi-factor ANOVA:One-way ANOVA: Used when there is one independent variable and one dependent variable.For example, compare the effects of different teaching methods on student test scores.Multifactor ANOVA: Used when there are two or more independent variables.For example, consider the impact of both teaching methods and learning materials on student test scores.Theoretical basis of ANOVA:The core of ANOVA is to decompose the total variation into within-group variation and between-group variation, and based on these variations, determine whether there is a significant difference in the mean values ​​between groups.Total Variation: The sum of the differences between a data point and the overall mean.Between-group Variation: The difference between the average of different groups and the overall average.Within-group Variation: The difference between the data points within each group and the respective group mean.ANOVA tests hypotheses by calculating the F statistic.The F statistic is the ratio of the mean squared difference between groups (the variation between groups divided by the degrees of freedom) to the mean squared difference within the group (the variation within the group divided by the degrees of freedom).If the difference between groups is significantly greater than the difference within the group, the F statistic will increase accordingly, indicating that there may be significant differences between different groups.hypothetical test:In ANOVA, there are usually two assumptions:Null hypothesis (H0): The means of all groups are equal.Alternative hypothesis (H1): At least one group has a mean that is different from the other groups.If the P value corresponding to the obtained F statistic is less than the preset significance level (for example, 0.05), the null hypothesis is rejected, which indicates that the mean of at least one group is significantly different from the other groups.
